This folder contains MATLAB, gnuplot and data files needed for reproducing Figures 4-9 from the paper K.B. Blyuss, Y.N. Kyrychko, "Mathematical model of replication-mutation dynamics in coronaviruses".

Folders Fig4, Fig5, Fig6 contain MATLAB files that find stability boundaries for extinction, mutant-only, and mixed steady states. Corresponding parameter regions, where these steady states are stable,
are plotted using gnuplot files in each of the folders.

Folder Fig7 contains MATLAB files required for finding boundaries for transition between extinction and mixed steady states, as well as the file that plots Figure 7.

Folders Fig8 and Fig8 contain MATLAB files that determine boundaries for transition between extinction and mixed steady states for different types of drug treatment.
